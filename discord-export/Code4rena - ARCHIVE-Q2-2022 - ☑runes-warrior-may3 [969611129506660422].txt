Thanks for the video, @dotta! I really appreciate the overview. Is there any context you can share about the design of the price function? I'm curious if there's any specific motivation for using several steps rather than a pure linear decrease.

it's just easier for people to understand


[05/03/2022 8:43 PM] .dotta
I had it as a linear decrease in the beginning, but steps seemed easier to communicate to the community

When que hace the report? Im impatient

Hang in there! :hi5: The sponsor is currently reviewing the submissions and then it will get handed off to a judge. There were close to 300 submissions, so it was a pretty big one and takes a bit of time for them to go through. After judging is finished and awards announced, then we can start work on getting that report out to ya! 🙂

Woow - 300 submissions is a lot, are those mostly QAs and Gas reports or are there also many meds/highs?


[05/09/2022 7:45 PM] liveactionllamac4
Looks like 120ish total medium/high submissions, and just under 80 submissions each for the Gas and QA categories. These are just early numbers though and won't necessarily reflect what the repo looks like after de-duping, etc.

woahh does that mean ~80 wardens / teams participated in the contest? 😮


[05/10/2022 5:05 AM] liveactionllamac4
Appears so! These are still early numbers though, so not sure if all participants submitted valid reports, etc.

Maybe some people submitted individual reports for low/qa ones as previously? Pretty immense if not, also means competition is so high now😅

The preliminary judging results are currently with the sponsor for review and any additional discussions, before finalizing. So hopefully this one will be finishing up soon! 🤞
